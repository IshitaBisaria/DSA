1. Modular Arithmetic
2. Euclid's Algorithm for GCD and LCM
3. Trailing Zeroes in a Factorial
4. Check for Prime Numbers :  O(n), O(sqrt(n)), leaving iterations for 2 and 3 O(sqrt(n)
5. Prime Factors : O(n^2logn), O(nlogn), leaving iterations for 2 and 3
6. All Divisors for a Number : Not in order, In order
7. Sieve of Erathosthenes
8. Power of a Number : Recursive, Iterartive
9. Digits in a Factorial : for n < 10^5 : floor of the log10 of a number + 1 gives the number of digits in the number
10. Digits in a Factorial : for n > 10^5 : Kamenetskyâ€™s formula : Factorial = log10((n/e)^n * sqrt(2*pi*n)), digits = floor(factorial) + 1
11. Exactly 3 Divisors : Only the squares of prime numbers are the numbers with exactly 3 divisors.
